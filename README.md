Description
-----------
A fast and high quality sampling system.

* uniform sampling at more than 1 millions points / second
* adaptive sampling from image or function

This is an implementation of the article "Fast Tile-Based Adaptive Sampling with User-Specified Fourier Spectra" published in ACM SIGGRAPH 2014
See http://liris.cnrs.fr/polyhex

This repository provide:

* source code with tools to generate uniform and adaptive sampling.
* sampler-cli: a command line tool to generate uniform sampling.
* sampler-gui: a Qt interface to explore the capacities of the sampling system (uniform and adaptive sampling).


Build
-----

To build the sampler, several packages are requires:

* cmake (http://cmake.org) to generate the build project.
* Qt4 (Gui) (http://qt.digia.com)
* Boost (and boost-progam-options) for command-line parsing (http://boost.org)
* OpenGL with GLSL (version 330 minimum)
* SDL and SDL_image library


A classical commandline build process looks like

    mkdir build  ##Generate build folder
    cd build
    cmake ..     ##Check dependencies and generate a makefile
    make         ##Build

For best performances, you can compile with optimized flags: `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`

Once built, several executables are available in `build/bin`:

* `sampler-cli: command line uniform and adaptive sampling tool
* `sampler-gui: Qt base sampler (uniform, adaptive, ...)


Data
----

This program needs full offsets table to produce best sampling distribution.
These tables are heavy (1.5G) and can be downloaded here: http://liris.cnrs.fr/polyhex/data/

Aternatively, `make GetLUT` (GetLUT target in your IDE) will download the data file to the folder `{your-build-folder}/data/lut`.


Usage examples
--------------

**sampler-cli**

Usage examples:

`./bin/sampler-cli -r data/lut/production_rules.dat -b data/lut/barycenters.dat -d data/lut/offsets_bnot.dat -n 1024 -o sampling.txt`

This procudes a uniform sampling with BNOT target spectra as a text file `sampling.txt` with x and y coordinates of the 1024 sample points. When plotting these points (e.g. with gnuplot), we obtain:

`./bin/sampler-cli -r data/lut/production_rules.dat -b data/lut/barycenters.dat -d data/lut/offsets_bnot.dat -i butterfly.png -o sampling.txt`

This procudes an adaptive sampling with BNOT target spectra as a text file `sampling.txt` with x and y coordinates of the sample points. 
When plotting these points (e.g. with gnuplot), we obtain

(with -K 29) ![CLIsampling](doc/samples-adaptive-65k.png) 

**sampler-gui**

`./bin/sampler-gui -r data/lut/production_rules.dat -b data/lut/barycenters.dat -d data/lut/offsets_bnot.dat`

> *TIPS:*

> * You can use mouse scroll on almost all buttons to change their values more easily.

> * Activate `Auto` mode to generate new sampling each time a parameter changes.
